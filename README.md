### Project Overview
---

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- Identify sales trend?
- What are order by city?
- What are order by region?
- What are order by category? 
- What are order by segement? 

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;
```

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the year 2017.
2. Order by Category Binders is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue .
3. City of Newyork orders were highest among all other city a .
4. Consumer segments that has highest value  of order should be targeted for more sales.
5. Western region has the highest order which should be focus for more sales and we need more advetisement in the least region.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions in the least categories copiers to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category Binders.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.
- The city of Newyork should be more targeted city for more sales.
  

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between sales and profit.
